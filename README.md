Pre-defined constants from all disciplines (math, physics, ...) as a Rust library.

Add this to your Cargo.toml file:

```
natural_constants = "0.2.0"
```

## Currently the following modules exist:

- math
- physics
- chemistry
- biology
- engineering
- conversion

It's far from complete. So if your favorite constant is missing, just let me know.

What should go in ? Everything that you think is useful. Some constants may fit into multiple modules - we then have to decide which one.

- Why are you using long names for the constants ? Why not a simple character like 'c' ?

Well simple characters are often used ("overloaded") by various constants, so to avoid ambiguity the full name is used.

- But isn't that too complicated to type ? Now my code looks too ugly!

Well no one stops you from doing s.th. like this:

```rust
use natural_constants::physics::*;

fn main() {
    let c = speed_of_light_vac;
    let m0 = 100.0;

    // Use c in your code:
    let E = m0 * c * c;
}
```

- What about pre-calculated stuff ?

Yes, why not ? If it's useful to you, it may also be useful to others.

This is an ongoing effort to make Rust more suitable for scientific / numeric computing, you can join the discussion [here](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/numerics-math-foundation/7247).
